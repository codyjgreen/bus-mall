**Bus Mall Project Domain**

**Developer:**

1. As a developer, I want to have a user with three product images to choose from.

2. As a developer, I want to keep record of what picture is chosen by the user.

3. As a developer, I want to generate three new pictures upon click

4. As a developer, the survey should end after the user selects 25 pictures.

5. As a developer, I want the survey to generate a 'View Results' button when the 25 clicks are up.

6. As a developer, I need to make sure the same pic doesn't repeat after a click.

**Marketing:**

1. Marketing team needs to be able to see individual research participant selections.

2. Marketing team needs to be able to see the total participant selections of multiple users.

3. Marketing team should be able to easily access the stored data.

**Participant**

1. Research participants need to know what they are supposed to do when they get to the page (clear directions above the picture selection area possibly).

2. Research participants should be able to easily navigate through the survey without getting confused by too much going on.

3. The page should be appealing to the eyes we don't want the research participant to feel like it is an eye sore so i will style the page nicely.
