**Developer:**

3.As a developer, I want to keep record of what the picture clicks do

4.As a developer, I want to generate three new pictures upon click

5.As a developer, I want to end the survey after 25 of the user's choices

6.As a developer, I want the survey to generate a 'View Results' button when the click threshold has been met.

7.As a developer, I need to make sure the same pic doesn't repeat after a click.

**Marketing:**

1.Marketing professionals need to be able to easily view individual research participant selections

2.Marketing professionals need to be able to easily view the total participant selections of multiple users

3.Marketing professionals need to have easy access to the stored data without needing to go through the survey themselves (thus diluting the data)

**Research Participant**

1.Research participants need a clear understanding of the task in front of them

2.Research participants need to have clean, working code that creates as little confusion as possible for their volunteer efforts

3.Research participants need to have a reasonably appealing survey interface to interact with--people like attractive and simple websites
